## Installation

1. Install [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

1. Run the command `npm install -g yo` then `npm install -g generator-edje`.

1. If you are on Windows, add `NODE_PATH` to your System Variable, set it to the `npm` directory. By default it should be in `C:/Users/yourname/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules`

1. Test whether it's successfully installed by running the command `yo`. If not found, try restarting your PC and double-check your `NODE_PATH`.


## Getting Started

1. Create your project directory.
2. Open command prompt inside the directory (Read below for guide).
3. Type in `yo edje` and select the template you need.
4. Done! Our template should now be in your project directory.

The Sass files in our template are compiled using [Edje](https://github.com/hrsetyono/edje), a lightweight framework.

## Opening Terminal inside Directory

**Windows**: SHIFT + Right-click the directory > Open command here.

**Mac**: System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts > Services. Find "New Terminal at Folder" and tick the box. Now whenever you right-click a directory, it will have that option.
